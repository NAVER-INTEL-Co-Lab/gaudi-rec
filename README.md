# Microbenchmarks and Recommendation System (RecSys) for Gaudi-v2

This repository hosts a collection of microbenchmarks and recommendation system operations tailored for Gaudi-v2. Our work focuses on optimizing performance and providing efficient implementations for key operations. Specifically, we aim to deliver the following contributions:

- **Microbenchmarks**: Evaluation of compute, memory, and communication primitives on Gaudi-v2.  
- **TPC Kernel for EmbeddingBag**: Implementation of a table-batched embeddingbag operation optimized for Gaudi-v2.  
- **TPC Kernel for Data Preprocessing**: Development of a custom kernel for efficient data preprocessing.

### Current Status

We have implemented the **embeddingbag operation** for Gaudi-v2 and are actively working on additional kernels and benchmarks. Further updates will be provided as progress continues.
